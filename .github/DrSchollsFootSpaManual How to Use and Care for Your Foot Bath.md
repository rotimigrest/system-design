Once you have found your Dr Scholls foot spa manual online, you can use it to learn how to use your foot spa properly. Here are some general tips on how to use a Dr Scholls foot spa manual:

2. Check the safety precautions and warnings in the manual. Do not use your foot spa if you have any medical conditions, injuries, or allergies that might affect your feet or circulation. Do not use your foot spa near water sources, electrical outlets, or heat sources. Do not immerse your foot spa in water or use it with extension cords.
3. Choose the settings and features that suit your preferences and needs. Some foot spas have different modes, speeds, temperatures, bubbles, massage rollers, pedicure attachments, and aromatherapy options. Refer to the manual for how to adjust and activate these features.
4. Clean and store your foot spa after each use. Follow the instructions on how to drain, rinse, dry, and disinfect your foot spa. Do not use harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners on your foot spa. Store your foot spa in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
