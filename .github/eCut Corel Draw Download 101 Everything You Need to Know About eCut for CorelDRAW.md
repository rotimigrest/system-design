## What is eCut and what can it do?
 
eCut is a separate DLL file that you can launch only using macros. That is why VBA is necessary to use the plugin[^2^]. eCut has a user-friendly interface that integrates with CorelDRAW and gives you access to various tools and features. Some of the most useful functions of eCut are:
 
- **Nesting:** This function allows you to arrange multiple shapes on a sheet of material in an optimal way to minimize waste and save costs. You can choose between true shape nesting, which fits the shapes according to their contours, or rectangle nesting, which fits the shapes according to their bounding boxes.
- **Cutter:** This function allows you to prepare your design for cutting or plotting on different devices. You can create cut lines, weeding lines, crop marks, contour cutting files, and optimize the cutting path. You can also separate curves, remove duplicate edges, slice shapes, and connect opened paths.
- **Measure:** This function allows you to measure various parameters of your design, such as perimeter, area, cost, time, volume, etc. You can also create reference scales and hotwire cutting files.
- **Effects:** This function allows you to apply various effects to your design, such as creating lines, grids, drafts, LEDs, neon, variable edge rolls, eyelets, etc.
- **CAD:** This function allows you to perform various CAD operations on your design, such as creating bridges, center lines, fillet curves, reducing nodes, composite signboxes, clever divide carriers, etc. You can also export your design as DXF files.
- **Useful:** This function allows you to perform various useful operations on your design, such as aligning objects, setting sizes, replacing shapes, finding duplicates or intersections,

and more.
