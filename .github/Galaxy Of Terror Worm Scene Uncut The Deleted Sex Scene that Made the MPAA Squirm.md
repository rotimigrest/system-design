One of the most notorious scenes in the film involves a female crew member named Dameia (played by Taaffe O'Connell) who is terrified of maggots. She is attacked by a giant worm-like creature that rapes and devours her in a graphic and prolonged sequence. The scene was controversial for its explicit sexual violence and gore, and was heavily censored in some countries.
 
The worm scene was created by a young James Cameron, who worked as the production designer and second unit director on the film. Cameron used a latex puppet and a lot of slime to create the realistic effect of the worm. He also directed the scene himself, reportedly pushing O'Connell to act more convincingly. O'Connell later said that she felt violated and traumatized by the experience, and that she regretted doing the film.
 
Galaxy Of Terror has gained a cult following over the years for its low-budget but creative special effects, its eclectic cast of B-movie actors, and its twisted plot. The film has been compared to Alien, which came out two years earlier, and has influenced other sci-fi horror films such as Event Horizon and Pandorum. The worm scene remains one of the most shocking and memorable moments in cinema history.
  
The film features a diverse cast of actors, some of whom became famous later in their careers. Edward Albert plays Cabren, the main protagonist and a cool-headed space veteran. Erin Moran plays Alluma, the ship's empath who can sense emotions. Ray Walston plays Kore, the ship's cook and a former master of crystals. Taaffe O'Connell plays Dameia, the ship's technical officer and the victim of the worm scene. Bernard Behrens plays Commander Ilvar, the overall commander of the mission. Zalman King plays Baelon, the rescue unit's team leader and Cabren's rival. Robert Englund plays Ranger, a young and enthusiastic crew member. Sid Haig plays Quuhod, a silent and mysterious crew member who carries a crystal weapon. Grace Zabriskie plays Captain Trantor, a traumatized survivor of a space disaster and the pilot of the Quest.
 
The film was produced by Roger Corman, who was known for making low-budget but profitable films with emerging talents. The film's budget was $1.8 million, which was relatively high for a Corman production. The film was shot in 18 days at various locations in Los Angeles, including an abandoned aircraft factory and a sewage treatment plant. The film's production design and special effects were supervised by James Cameron, who later became famous for directing films such as The Terminator, Aliens, Titanic and Avatar. Cameron also directed some scenes as the second unit director, including the worm scene and the final confrontation between Cabren and the Planet Master.
 
The film was released on October 23, 1981 by New World Pictures in the United States and by United Artists internationally. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its visual effects and atmosphere but criticized its plot and acting. The film was also compared unfavorably to Alien, which came out two years earlier and had a similar premise of a spaceship crew facing an alien horror. The film earned $4 million at the box office, making it a modest success for Corman.
