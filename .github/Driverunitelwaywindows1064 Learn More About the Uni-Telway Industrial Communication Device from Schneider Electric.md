- Make sure your PLC is powered on and connected to your computer via a Unitelway cable.
- Make sure you have selected the correct COM port and baud rate for your communication driver.
- Make sure you have configured the correct address and protocol for your PLC.
- Make sure there are no conflicts or interferences with other devices or programs using the same COM port.
