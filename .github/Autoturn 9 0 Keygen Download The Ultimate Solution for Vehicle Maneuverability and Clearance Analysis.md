## What are the features of AutoTURN Pro 9.0?
 
AutoTURN Pro 9.0 is the most advanced version of AutoTURN, the leading software for vehicle swept path analysis and turn simulation. It offers many features that help you design safer and more efficient transportation facilities in 2D and 3D environments. Some of the features of AutoTURN Pro 9.0 are:

- **Swept Path 2.0 Technology:** This patented technology allows you to simulate refined vehicle movements by inserting waypoints, adjusting speeds, and controlling individual wheel steering. You can also detach parts of multi-part vehicles and analyze their movements separately.
- **3D Clearance Analysis:** This feature enables you to generate 3D swept path envelopes with vehicle height and ground clearance data, and check for conflicts with terrain elevation and overhead obstacles. You can also export 3D animations and videos of your simulations.
- **Sightline Analysis:** This feature enables you to perform sightline analysis on horizontal alignments and vertical profiles, and check for adequate visibility along a vehicle path. You can also customize the sightline parameters and display options.
- **Vehicle Library:** AutoTURN Pro 9.0 includes over 1300 vehicles in its manufacturer-specific and standard design vehicle libraries, covering a wide range of categories such as passenger cars, trucks, buses, bicycles, emergency vehicles, industrial vehicles, and more. You can also create and edit your own custom vehicles.
- **Smart Path Tools:** These tools allow you to generate vehicle paths automatically based on speed, superelevation, lateral friction, and turn radius data. You can also use smart path tools to reverse a vehicle path, mirror a vehicle path, or offset a vehicle path.
- **Reporting and Presentation:** AutoTURN Pro 9.0 allows you to create professional reports and presentations of your swept path analysis results. You can customize the report layout, content, and format, and export it as a PDF or RTF file. You can also create dynamic presentations with interactive 3D views, animations, and videos.

AutoTURN Pro 9.0 is compatible with various CAD platforms such as AutoCAD, MicroStation, BricsCAD, ZWCAD, and IntelliCAD. It also supports BIM workflows with Autodesk Revit.
