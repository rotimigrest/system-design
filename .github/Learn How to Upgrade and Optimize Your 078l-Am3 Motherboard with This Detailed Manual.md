## Step 2: Install the CPU and Memory
 
Next, you need to install the CPU and memory on the motherboard. The 078l-Am3 motherboard supports AMD Socket AM3 processors, such as Phenom II, Athlon II, and Sempron. To install the CPU, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the socket lever and lift it up to a 90-degree angle.
2. Align the CPU with the socket and gently insert it into the socket. Make sure the CPU is oriented correctly and fits into the socket without forcing it.
3. Lower the socket lever and lock it into place.
4. Apply a thin layer of thermal paste on top of the CPU. This will help transfer heat from the CPU to the cooler.
5. Attach the CPU cooler on top of the CPU and secure it with screws or clips. Connect the CPU fan cable to the CPU\_FAN header on the motherboard.

The 078l-Am3 motherboard supports up to 8GB of DDR3 memory in four DIMM slots. The memory speed can be up to 1333MHz or 1066MHz depending on the CPU. To install the memory, follow these steps:

1. Align the memory module with the slot and push it down firmly until it clicks into place. Make sure the notch on the module matches the notch on the slot.
2. Repeat for each memory module you want to install.

## Step 3: Install the Motherboard in the Case
